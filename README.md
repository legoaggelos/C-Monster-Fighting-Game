This is a game where you fight monsters written in C++. 
I did this as a quiz from learncpp.com, as I am learning C++. The random.h header is the exact same as the one in https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/global-random-numbers-random-h/, so I didn't include it in the project files.
I also have a few useless imports, don't ask why.
I might add potions sometime.
